FTL Oculus
---

A project I did way back in 2013 for Oculus' VRJam. Using the Oculus DK1, photon networking, and Unity 4.1.5. I tried making 3d FTL with multiplayer. I thought I did really well but I realized at the end I messed up the movement. 

Really fun and disorienting anti gravity though.

This was back before I knew what source control was so all metadata files are missing. It is just for reference now.
